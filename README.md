# Gesture Gaming using Python
This program can be used to play a shooting game (or like it) by detecting hand gestures to control movement of the gun on the screen. It has been implemented in Python using OpenCV library. 
Although, the demo shown here refers to playing a shooting game, it can be used to play any game or control any application using hand gestures only.
